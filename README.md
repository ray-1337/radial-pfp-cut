# Radial Profile Picture Cut
This is a project where you can pan and crop the image, and turn it into a perfect circular profile picture.

## Motive
I created this because the Instagram browser doesn't have a pan-and-crop feature, and I have to transfer the profile picture to my phone via Bluetooth just to use that feature.

So, I created this project for a social media platform that doesn't accommodate this feature.
